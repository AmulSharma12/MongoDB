- MySQL and MongoDB database terms.
  - databases
  - tables = collections
  - rows = documents

- MongoDB internally uses bson which is similar to json As, bson is more efficient than json.
- example of docuemnts and fields.
  - one document/row containing 4 fields with value.

```json
{
  "name": "xxx",

## 🚀 <b>Cheatsheets of MongoDB query in shell</b>

## 📌 <b>MongoDB - database related query syntax</b>

<hr>

- Give all the databases.

```cmd
show dbs
```

- creating a new database
  - if database already exist switch to that database.

```sh
use databasename
```

- database you are currently working.

```sh
db
```

- Deleting the database
  - must check the database you are working by above command then only delete the database.

```sh
db.dropDatabase()
```

## 📌 <b>MongoDB - Collections/table related query syntax</b>

<hr>

- creating new collection/table of users name

```sh
db.createCollections('users')
```

- droping the collection/table
  - users is the name of collection/table.

```sh
db.users.drop()
```

- <b><i>We will be working through out with users collection/table as an example.</i></b>

## 📌 <b>MongoDB - document/row related query syntax</b>

<hr>

### ⭐ inserting document/row

- inserting a single document in a collections
  - it takes javascript object in form of key:value pair

```sh
db.users.insertOne({name:"xyz", age:21})
```

- insertMany() takes array of objects

```sh
db.users.insertMany(
  [
      {
          name:"amul"
          age:21
      },
      {
          name:"pedro",
          age:29
      }
  ]
)
```

### ⭐ Filter in collection/table using find()

- give all the rows/document in users table

```sh
db.users.find()
```

- give all the rows/document in pretty/formatted form

```sh
db.users.find().pretty()
```

- give all the rows/document in users table matching the object with name as amul.

```sh
db.users.find( {name:"amul"} )
```

### ⭐ updating document/row

- updating the existing document
  - update(filter , updation , options )
  - first object is filter, second updation, third option

```sh
db.users.update({name:'amul'},
  {
      $set:{
          name:'amul sharma'
      }
  }
)
```

### ⭐ deleting document/row

- deleting single document
  - also if multiple document present with that filter older document will be delete at first.

```sh
db.users.deleteOne({name:'amul'})
```

- deleting all the document with that filter

```sh
db.users.deleteMany({name:'amul'})
```

## 📌 <b>MongoDB - Operators</b>

<hr>

### ⭐ Compairison Operators

- $eq - return all document equal to specified value.

```sh
db.users.find( {age: {$eq:21}})
```

```sh
db.users.find( {name: {$eq:'amul'}})
```

- $lt - return all document less than specified value.

```sh
db.users.find( {age: {$lt:21}} )
```

- $lte - return all document less than equal to specified value.

```sh
db.users.find( {age: {$lte:21}} )
```

- $gt- return all document greater than specified value.

```sh
db.users.find( {age: {$gt:21}} )
```

- $gte- return all document greater than equal to specified value.

```sh
db.users.find( {age: {$gte:21}} )
```

- $gte- return all document not equal to specified value.

```sh
db.users.find( {age: {$ne:21}} )
```

### ⭐ Logical Operators

- $or- both condition should be true then it will return the document.
  - $and: [condition1 , condition2]

```sh
db.users.find(
  {
    $and: [
    {name: {$eq:'amul'}},
    {age: {$eq:21}}
    ]
  }
)
```


- $and - either of condition should be true it would return that document/row.
  - $or: [condition1 , condition2]

```sh
db.users.find(
  {
    $or: [
    {name: {$eq:'amul'}},
    {age: {$eq:29}}
    ]
  }
)
```
